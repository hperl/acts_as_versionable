= Acts As Versionable

==== Why?
  Since I found no good plugins/gems I decided to write my own.
  (acts_as_versioned does not support current rails with dirty attribute handling, version_fu does not provide easy to use sintax)

==== What will it be used for?
  Tracking the versions.
  Applying diffs to the versions of to the specific instances of the model.
  Reverting bitween versions.
  Will give you possibility track changes on only required fields of your model.
